## Problem 1

Reading and cleaning the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet.

``` r
trash_wheel_df = 
  read_excel("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", 
  sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", 
  range = "A2:N408") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls, digits = 0))
```

Reading and cleaning precipitation data for 2018.

``` r
precip_2018_df = 
  read_excel ("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
             sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
             range = "A2:B15") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(total) %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018)
```

Reading and cleaning precipitation data for 2019.

``` r
precip_2019_df = 
  read_excel ("data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
             sheet = "2019 Precipitation",
             range = "A2:B15") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(total) %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2019)
```

Combining precipitation data sets.

``` r
precipitation_df = 
  full_join(precip_2018_df, precip_2019_df) %>%
  mutate(month = recode(month, 
        `1`= "January", `2`= "February", `3`= "March", `4`= "April",
        `5`= "May", `6`= "June", `7`= "July", `8`= "August", 
        `9`=  "September", `10`= "October", `11`= "November", 
        `12`= "December")
    )
```

    ## Joining, by = c("month", "total", "year")

The number of observations in the cleaned Mr. Trash Wheel data is 344.
There are 14 variables in the cleaned Mr. Trash Wheel data. Examples of
key variables are dumpster, month, year, date, and homes\_powered. The
median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2019 was 8.5. The number
of observations in the cleaned 2018 and 2019 precipitation data is 18.
There are 3 variables in the precipitation data, which are month, total,
year. The total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33.
